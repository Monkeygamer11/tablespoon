## Contributing

So you want to contribute? Well feel more than welcomed to!

### Commits

Commits should follow the rules of [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), if they do not follow this you will be asked to fix your commits.

### Adding commands

All commands are kept within the `/cmd` directory and are named by the init function at the bottom of the file.

### Adding customization

To add to the customization (depending on what is being added) you can find most of the code for the customization in the rules function in `cmd/generate.go`
